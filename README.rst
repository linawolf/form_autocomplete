Autocomplete
============

The :guilabel:`Autocomplete` select in the form editor can be used to
define :html:`autocomplete` properties for input fields. This extension
predefines the most common of the input purposes that are widely
recognized by assistive technologies and
`recommended by the W3C <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes>`__. The
HTML standard allows arbitrary values.

If you need to provide additional fields, you can reconfigure the autocomplete
field with additional select options:

Extend the EXT:form configuration:

EXT:my_sitepackage/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript::

    plugin.tx_form {
      settings {
        yamlConfigurations {
          # register your own additional configuration
          # choose a number higher than 10 (10 is reserved)
          100 = EXT:my_sitepackage/Configuration/Form/CustomFormSetup.yaml
        }
      }
    }

Redefine the backend input in the extended YAML:

EXT:my_sitepackage/Configuration/Form/CustomFormSetup.yaml::

                  12345:
                    value: 'cc-name'
                    label: 'cc-name - Full name as given on the payment instrument'
